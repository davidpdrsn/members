# App for managing members of a martial arts club

## Models

- Users (admins)
- Members
  - Enum for `membership_type`
    - Active
    - Passive

## What we'll do today

- Generate the app

- Get the TDD ball rolling
  - Add the first test and watch it fail
  - Use poltergeist for testing with a browser

- Sign up as admin through a protected endpoint
  - Using `clearance` gem

- Basic CRUD for members
  - Including filtering like how many of each membership type
  - How many members do we have under and over the age of 25

- Deploy to Heroku (maybe)

We wont be worrying about any UI
